# Sifflet MCP

## When to use

- Resolve tables, dashboards, or other assets before writing SQL or Monitors as Code YAML.
- Inspect or compare existing monitors and incidents.
- Understand downstream lineage or blast radius for a change.

## Setup

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) so `uvx` is available (recommended by [Sifflet MCP server](https://docs.siffletdata.com/docs/sifflet-mcp-server)).
2. Create a **Viewer** (or appropriate) API token in Sifflet ([docs](https://docs.siffletdata.com/docs/generate-an-api-token)).
3. Set **`SIFFLET_API_TOKEN`** and **`SIFFLET_BACKEND_URL`** for MCP: the plugin’s `mcp.json` forwards those env vars when Cursor can resolve them, and the bundled launcher falls back to **`~/.sifflet/config.ini`** (from **`sifflet configure`**) when they are unset or unresolved placeholders. See **configure-sifflet-auth**. Shell-only exports (**`~/.zshrc`**) are not visible to MCP unless they are also present on the Cursor app process, so a correct **`echo`** in the integrated terminal does not prove MCP sees the variable.
4. Use the backend URL form expected by [sifflet-mcp](https://github.com/siffletdata/sifflet-mcp), usually **`https://<tenant>.siffletdata.com/api/`** (note the **`/api/`** suffix).

## Working style

- Prefer **discovery tools first** (`search_asset`, `asset_by_urn`) so YAML and proposals use real URNs, owners, and tags.
- For **`get_monitor_code_by_description`**: always pass at least one **`dataset_ids`** entry from discovery; before calling, run the **monitor-type questionnaire** in the **sifflet-quality-as-code** skill (step 2) so the **`description`** includes thresholds, time columns, SQL, allowed values, etc., when those inputs are required for that **`parameters.kind`**.
- For monitor authoring, combine MCP results with the **sifflet-quality-as-code** skill and the official schema docs.
- Do not paste secrets into chat or commit them to the repository.
